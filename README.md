Text-Based Rpg Framework
======

The goal of this project is to develop a system for a more in-depth text adventure-like RPG. Some of the planned features are listed below:
- Easy to use text system that allows for font tags to be injected into it
- Complex character stat system -- power is more interesting than simply leveling up and allows for growth via in-game actions
- Fully modular and moveable UI system. The windows can be dragged around the screen, as well as any specific object in the component (items are physically dragged).
- Unique armor system -- armor can cover specific parts of the body and may occupy one or more armor slot. This armor can potentially block damage, but takes damage in the process.
- A more engaging combat system, focused less on grinding and mindlessly hitting the same button and more on carefully considering the situation, and using your actions wisely
- Journal system designed to save dialogue that the player chooses for better storytelling
- Usable on Android. Future support for iOS is planned.
